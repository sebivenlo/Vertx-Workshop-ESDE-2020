# Vertx-workshop

Vertx is a java framework that allows you to develop concurrent event-driven application. This workshop is supposed to teach fundamental concepts as well as relevant use cases.

### Start the application using Docker
create a Vert.x docker image of our application.

#### build the image with:
    docker build -t vertx_rest  .
This creates an image name vertx_test which we can now execute.

### Then run it with :                
    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 vertx_test
